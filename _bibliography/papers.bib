  abstract={Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most prevalent rheumatic disorders in children and is classified as an autoimmune disease (AID). While a robust genetic contribution to JIA etiology has been established, the exact pathogenesis remains unclear. To prioritize biologically interpretable susceptibility genes and proteins for JIA, we conducted transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association studies (TWAS/PWAS). Then, to understand the genetic architecture of JIA, we systematically analyzed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability, a signature of natural selection, and polygenicity. Next, we conducted HLA typing using multi-ethnicity RNA sequencing data. Additionally, we examined the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire at a single-cell level to explore the potential links between immunity and JIA risk. We have identified 19 TWAS genes and two PWAS proteins associated with JIA risks. Furthermore, we observe that the heritability and cell type enrichment analysis of JIA are enriched in T lymphocytes and HLA regions and that JIA shows higher polygenicity compared to other AIDs. In multi-ancestry HLA typing, B*45:01 is more prevalent in African JIA patients than in European JIA patients, whereas DQA1*01:01, DQA1*03:01, and DRB1*04:01 exhibit a higher frequency in European JIA patients. Using single-cell immune repertoire analysis, we identify clonally expanded T cell subpopulations in JIA patients, including CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH cells which are significantly associated with JIA risks. Our findings shed new light on the pathogenesis of JIA and provide a strong foundation for future mechanistic studies aimed at uncovering the molecular drivers of JIA.},

  title={Novel insight into the etiology of ischemic stroke gained by integrative multiome-wide association study},
  author={Jung*, Junghyun and Lu, Zeyun and de Smith, Adam and Mancuso*, Nicholas},
  abstract={Stroke, characterized by sudden neurological deficits, is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified many genomic regions associated with ischemic stroke (IS), the genes underlying risk and their regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we integrate a large-scale GWAS (N = 1 296 908) for IS together with molecular QTLs data, including mRNA, splicing, enhancer RNA (eRNA), and protein expression data from up to 50 tissues (total N = 11 588). We identify 136 genes/eRNA/proteins associated with IS risk across 60 independent genomic regions and find IS risk is most enriched for eQTLs in arterial and brain-related tissues. Focusing on IS-relevant tissues, we prioritize 9 genes/proteins using probabilistic fine-mapping TWAS analyses. In addition, we discover that blood cell traits, particularly reticulocyte cells, have shared genetic contributions with IS using TWAS-based pheWAS and genetic correlation analysis. Lastly, we integrate our findings with a large-scale pharmacological database and identify a secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid, as a potential therapeutic component. Our work highlights IS risk genes/splicing-sites/enhancer activity/proteins with their phenotypic consequences using relevant tissues as well as identify potential therapeutic candidates for IS.},

  abstract={In standard genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the standard association test is underpowered to detect associations between loci with multiple causal variants with small effect sizes. We propose a statistical method, Model-based Association test Reflecting causal Status (MARS), that finds associations between variants in risk loci and a phenotype, considering the causal status of variants, only requiring the existing summary statistics to detect associated risk loci. Utilizing extensive simulated data and real data, we show that MARS increases the power of detecting true associated risk loci compared to previous approaches that consider multiple variants, while controlling the type I error.},

  abstract={Ample evidence indicates that insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to white adipose tissue (WAT), but the underlying mechanisms of IR pathogenesis are still unclear. Using 352 microarray datasets from seven independent studies, we identified a meta-signature which comprised of 1,413 genes. Our meta-signature was also enriched in overall WAT in in vitro and in vivo IR models. Only 12 core enrichment genes were consistently enriched across all IR models. Among the meta-signature, we identified a drug signature made up of 211 genes with expression levels that were co-regulated by thiazolidinediones and metformin using cross-species analysis. To confirm the clinical relevance of our drug signature, we found that the expression levels of 195 genes in the drug signature were significantly correlated with both homeostasis model assessment 2-IR score and body mass index. Finally, 18 genes from the drug signature were identified by protein-protein interaction network cluster. Four core enrichment genes were included in 18 genes and the expression levels of selected 8 genes were validated by quantitative PCR. These findings suggest that our signatures provide a robust set of genetic markers which can be used to provide a starting point for developing potential therapeutic targets in improving IR in WAT.},
