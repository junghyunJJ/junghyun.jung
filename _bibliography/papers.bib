  abstract={In standard genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the standard association test is underpowered to detect associations between loci with multiple causal variants with small effect sizes. We propose a statistical method, Model-based Association test Reflecting causal Status (MARS), that finds associations between variants in risk loci and a phenotype, considering the causal status of variants, only requiring the existing summary statistics to detect associated risk loci. Utilizing extensive simulated data and real data, we show that MARS increases the power of detecting true associated risk loci compared to previous approaches that consider multiple variants, while controlling the type I error.},

  abstract={In this study, we identified co-expressed gene set (DD signature) consisting of 753 genes via weighted gene co-expression network analysis. To confirm the robustness of DD signature, module enrichment analysis and meta-analysis were performed. Moreover, this signature effectively classified DD disease samples. The DD signature were significantly enriched in unfolded protein response (UPR) related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Next, we conducted multiple-phenotype regression analysis to identify trans-regulatory hotspots regulating expression levels of DD signature using Genotype-Tissue Expression data. Finally, 10 trans-regulatory hotspots and 16 eGenes genes that are significantly associated with at least one cis-eQTL were identified.},

  author={Jung, Junghyun and Kim, Go Woon and Lee, Woosuk and Mok, Changsoo and Chung, Sung Hyun and Jang, Wonhee},
  abstract={Ample evidence indicates that insulin resistance (IR) is closely related to white adipose tissue (WAT), but the underlying mechanisms of IR pathogenesis are still unclear. Using 352 microarray datasets from seven independent studies, we identified a meta-signature which comprised of 1,413 genes. Our meta-signature was also enriched in overall WAT in in vitro and in vivo IR models. Only 12 core enrichment genes were consistently enriched across all IR models. Among the meta-signature, we identified a drug signature made up of 211 genes with expression levels that were co-regulated by thiazolidinediones and metformin using cross-species analysis. To confirm the clinical relevance of our drug signature, we found that the expression levels of 195 genes in the drug signature were significantly correlated with both homeostasis model assessment 2-IR score and body mass index. Finally, 18 genes from the drug signature were identified by protein-protein interaction network cluster. Four core enrichment genes were included in 18 genes and the expression levels of selected 8 genes were validated by quantitative PCR. These findings suggest that our signatures provide a robust set of genetic markers which can be used to provide a starting point for developing potential therapeutic targets in improving IR in WAT.},
