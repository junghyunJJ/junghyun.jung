My name is Junghyun Jung. I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in [Dr. Nicholas Mancuso's lab](https://www.mancusolab.com/) in the [Center for Genetic Epidemiology](https://keck.usc.edu/genetic-epidemiology-center/) at [Keck School of Medicine](https://www.keckmedicine.org/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).

My research interests include developing a computational method to infer natural selection in the evolutionary architecture of molecular phenotype and analyzing multi-omics data to elucidate the etiology of complex traits.
 - Develop novel statistical methods using Variational Bayesian methods
 - Perform Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using GWAS summary statistic data with molecular QTL data
 - Analyze single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and TCR-seq analysis 
 
I received my Ph.D. in Life Science from [Dongguk University](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/main) in Korea, where I studied multi-omics integrative analysis  and method development for functional genomic data. While earning my Ph.D., I was advised by [Dr. Jong Wha (Joanne) Joo](https://cblab.yolasite.com/) and [Dr. Wonhee Jang](https://sites.google.com/view/dgu-janglab).

I also was a postdoctoral scholar in [Dr. Serghei Mangul's lab](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/) at [USC School of Pharmacy](https://pharmacyschool.usc.edu/) and my work aimed to analyze GWAS and WES data related to COVID-19 and the benchmarking study for HLA callers.

Please feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:junghyun.jung@usc.edu) if you have any questions.
