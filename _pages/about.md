My name is Junghyun Jung. I'm currently a Reserch data scientist in [Dr. Kyoung Jae Won's lab](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/labs/won.html) in the [Department of Computational Biomedicine](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/computational-biomedicine.html) at [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/).

My research interests include developing a computational method for analyzing single-cell datasets and analyzing multi-omics data to elucidate the etiology of complex traits.
 - Develop novel computational tools for single-cell and spatial omics datasets.
 - Perform Single-cell RNA/ATAC/TCR-seq data analysis as well as spatial omics data.
 - Perform integrative analysis using GWAS with molecular QTL (molQTL) data

 
I received my Ph.D. in Life Science from [Dongguk University](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/main) in Korea, where I studied multi-omics integrative analysis  and method development for functional genomic data. While earning my Ph.D., I was advised by [Dr. Jong Wha (Joanne) Joo](https://cblab.yolasite.com/) and [Dr. Wonhee Jang](https://sites.google.com/view/dgu-janglab).

I also was a postdoctoral scholar in 
[Dr. Nicholas Mancuso's lab](https://www.mancusolab.com/) at [Keck School of Medicine USC](https://www.keckmedicine.org/) and [Dr. Serghei Mangul's lab](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/) at [USC School of Pharmacy](https://pharmacyschool.usc.edu/). My work aimed to 
 - Develop a novel statistical method using Variational Bayesian methods.
 - Perform integrative analysis using Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) analysis
 - Analyze GWAS and WES data related to COVID-19 and the benchmarking study for Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) callers.
