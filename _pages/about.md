My name is Junghyun Jung. I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in [Dr. Nicholas Mancuso's lab](https://www.mancusolab.com/) in the [Center for Genetic Epidemiology](https://keck.usc.edu/genetic-epidemiology-center/) at [Keck School of Medicine](https://www.keckmedicine.org/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).

My research interests include developing a computational method to infer genetic architecture and analyzing functional genomic data to elucidate the etiology of complex traits and diseases.

I received my Ph.D. in Life Science from [Dongguk University](https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/main) in Korea, where I studied integrative analysis using multi-omics data and method development for genomic data. While earning my Ph.D., I was advised by [Dr. Jong Wha (Joanne) Joo](https://cblab.yolasite.com/) and [Dr. Wonhee Jang](https://sites.google.com/view/dgu-janglab).

I also was a postdoctoral scholar in [Dr. Serghei Mangul's lab](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/) at [USC School of Pharmacy](https://pharmacyschool.usc.edu/) and my work aimed to analyze GWAS and WES data related to COVID-19 and the benchmarking study for HLA callers.

Please feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:junghyun.jung@usc.edu) if you have any questions.
